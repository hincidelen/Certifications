Question format
All the questions follow this structure: ONE question and FOUR different possible answers.
With that in mind, there are TWO TYPES of giving answers:
* ONE RIGHT ANSWER: The answer options will be a clickable spot and you must select ONE CHOICE. This can be either select a valid answer in a true/false statement or a fill in blank example.
* MULTIPLE ANSWERS: The answer option will be a square-type and accepts MULTIPLE CHOICES. Before checking the answers, please refer to the question to ensure HOW MANY VALID CHOICES ARE.
There are no boolean questions (statement and then choose between True or False).
